true
Comment: or Location-Located.

003	"Where are the <e1>batteries</e1> kept in a <e2>phone</e2>?"
false
Comment: the sentence does not entail that the batteries are inside the phone, though it is a likely intepretation. The real issue is that batteries are part of what we normally consider a working phone.

004	"This answer leads me to think that the <e1>robber</e1> was inside the <e2>office</e2> when the manager decided to take action and escape out the side door."

Comment: Located-Location.

005	"Often the <e1>patient</e1> is kept in the <e2>hospital</e2> one night for observation, but in other cases the patient can be discharged home the same day as surgery."
false
Comment: not sure what relation it is. Either sense of "hospital" fits.

006	"<e1>Batteries</e1> stored in <e2>contact</e2> with one another can generate heat and hydrogen gas."
false
Comment: "in contact with" is a compound preposition, or a phrase which serves as a preposition.

007	"Among the contents of the <e1>vessel</e1> were a set of carpenter's <e2>tools</e2>, several large storage jars, ceramic utensils, ropes and remnants of food, as well as a heavy load of ballast stones."

Comment:

008	"You can put <e1>wine</e1> in the <e2>hookah water</e2>, and otherwise adulterate the tobacco and so on to change the flavor."
false
Comment: this cannot be Part-Whole (wine might be part, but water can only be whole after the putting has occurred -- something not entailed by the sentence). It is also not quite Located-Location: putting is not a fact but a possibility. Such temporal uncertainties are tough to interpret.

009	"And we do recommend excersise, as the <e1>kitchen</e1> holds <e2>culinary temptations</e2> in store for you that are bound to prolong your evening and lift your spirit."
false
Comment: Located-Location; it is a different sense of the verb "hold", and note that WN 3.0 offers 36 (!) senses.

010	"The <e1>catalogue</e1> contained <e2>books</e2> published in 1998 warning of the upcoming millennium bug and other similarly germane works, but neither of Brock's bestsellers."
false
Comment: a catalog is either "a complete list of things" or "a book or pamphlet containing an enumeration of things". There is metonymy here: a book means some "listable" identification of a book. This is Part-Whole.

011	"Vinegar's <e1>usefulness</e1> doesn't stop inside the <e2>house</e2>."

Comment: definitely no relation fits this example adequately.

Comment: ingredient, so Object-Stuff, a subcategory of Whole-Part.

014	"The <e1>library</e1> contained <e2>books</e2> of guidance on the processes."

Comment: marginal; Located-Location is tempting, too.

015	"The story not only put <e1>wine</e1> in a <e2>positive health light</e2>, but pointed out that it was superior to other foods in that particular regard."
false
Comment: a difficult case, and an instance of metonymy; no relation comes easily to mind.

Comment: Located-Location; Part-Whole if the antenna is attached.

Comment: no relation seems to fit...

031	"It has long been thought that the <e1>crypt</e1> contained the <e2>tomb</e2> of St Paul but the altar had hidden it."

Comment: both Located-Location and Whole-Part fit.

Comment:

036	"The <e1>kitchen</e1> holds a <e2>cooker</e2>, fridge, microwave oven, in short; everything you need if you want to prepare a light meal."
true
Comment: a cooker is not attached (only plugged in), and a kitchen without a cooker is possible, so the definition holds.

037	"Let us sprinkle flowers around and put <e1>wine</e1> in the <e2>cup</e2>."
false
Comment: the temporal element is at issue. The wine is not, and may never be, in the cup. There is no entailment to justify classifying this example as positive.

Comment: the best choice, but oddly the definition fails a little (one cannot get rid of acid).

Comment: Whole-Part.

056	"The <e1>box</e1> contained the jumbled <e2>skeletal remains</e2> of what appeared to be sheep, as well as a variety of other mammals."
true
Comment: there is a small problem with WN sense (the dead body of a human being -- not an animal). Perhaps it would be better not to assign a sense, though it seems like WN's minor omission.

057	"The discharge <e1>valve</e1> is kept in the <e2>closed position</e2> at all times unless the dike is deliberately being drained."

Comment: Located-Location.

086	"Remember to reverse the position of <e1>batteries</e1> stored in <e2>flashlights</e2> to prevent them from accidentally switching on and losing power."
true
Comment: a small dilemma. Batteries are stored/carried, but they also are part of a functioning flashlight. Still, the sentence entails that the batteries are inside the flashlight, and this is what matters.

091	"You haven't experienced true tartness until you've tasted the <e1>jelly</e1> inside a <e2>passionfruit</e2>."
false
Comment: Part-Whole? Note the spelling "passion fruit" in WN -- with a space. The WN sense of e1 (any substance having the consistency of jelly or gelatin) is iffy; the other two are not acceptable.

092	"A <e1>dining room</e1> that contains direct <e2>access</e2> from the kitchen is the most practical, unless the room will exist for fluff purposes only."

Comment: Part-Whole. In WN: access -- a way of entering or leaving ==> any artifact consisting of a path affording passage from one place to another.

false
Comment: Part-Whole.

111	"We actually put <e1>tea</e1> in the <e2>food</e2> whenever possible."
false
Comment: this cannot be Part-Whole (tea might be part, but food can only be whole after the putting has occurred -- something not entailed by the sentence). It is also not quite Located-Location: putting is not a fact but a possibility. Such temporal uncertainties are tough to interpret.

Comment: Whole-Part.

135	"On the other hand, the <e1>information</e1> being carried in a high frequency quasi-sinusoidal <e2>wave</e2> invites comparisons with the auditory system of vertebrates."
true
Comment: another example of metonymy (waves carry a physical representation of information). A wave is delimited in space, too, even if long (-:).

136	"This is why, not only the contents of the <e1>box</e1> were a <e2>present</e2>, but the box itself was as a present."
true
Comment: slightly iffy.

137	"Until 1729 the <e1>building</e1> contained only the <e2>grammar school</e2>."
false
Comment: Located-Location.

138	"Maybe some <e1>relationships</e1> are best kept in a <e2>box</e2>."
false

139	"Some inactivated influenza vaccine contains thimerosal, a <e1>preservative</e1> that contains <e2>mercury</e2>."

Comment: Object-Stuff, a subcategory of Whole-Part.

140	"The <e1>kitchen</e1> contains various commercial equipment such as <e2>stoves</e2>, griddles, deep fryer, and an oven."
true
Comment: this is a little unclear (in another example, flooring is part of a kitchen). A stove is not attached (only plugged in), and a kitchen without a stove is possible, so the definition holds.
